                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Xello is a comprehensive online platform that helps K-12 students explore and plan for their future careers and education.
                    The platform is designed to guide students through a personalized career exploration and planning process that helps them 
                    make informed decisions about their future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Software Engineer at Xello, primarily working on its in-house
                    <strong>Content Management System</strong> and <strong>Design System</strong>.

                <h3>Content Management System (Backend Focus)</h3>
                <p>
                    Xello's student side application lives off of data acquired from numerous sources. In order to manage all this data, Xello created an in-house
                    Content Management System, with its primary users being Xello's Content Research team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CMS is built on .NET Framework using C#, with a database handled using MSSQL. The CMS helps manage data sourced from over 10 unique external data
                    sources, alongside researcher-collected data. This data covers a huge list of Careers, Schools, and Majors that exist in Canada, the United Kingdom,
                    and the United States.
                </p>

                <h3>TACO - Design System (Frontend Focus)</h3>
                <p>
                    Xello consists of various applications dedicated towards Educators and Students of varying education levels. With multiple applications to manage,
                    the risk of inconsistent design became relevant.

                    To control this, Xello decided to create the TACO Design System to help maintain consistent design across all Xello applications, while also improving
                    frontend development experiences by providing reusable components and assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TACO Design System was created using Lit, a JavaScript framework intended for building agnostic web components.
                    Alongside the development of asset uploading and component generation scripts, TACO is a continuously growing Design System
                    with the help of other Xello developers.

                        <li>Overseeing the release of components from development to live production applications</li>
