                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    ZipPy is a (soon to be) virtual desktop assistant created with Python. The goal is for a user to use voice commands to 
                    ask ZipPy for assistance with a list of specified commands. ZipPy will provide vocal responses and execute 
                    the task requested by the user. A log of the responses from both the user and ZipPy would be viewable on small desktop widget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vocal recognition is possible with the use of the <a class=textLink href="https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/" target="_blank">speech_recognition</a> library. The vocal responses by ZipPy are done with text-to-speech
                    conversion using the <a class=textLink href="https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/" target="_blank">pyttsx3</a> library. The desktop widget that displays all the data is created by utilizing the <a class=textLink href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" target="_blank">tkinter</a> library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I have been able to create a widget that can listen to user voice commands and repeat what them back. These responses are also viewable on the
                    desktop widget. I am currently in the process of working on the vocal response by ZipPy. Once the core listening/response functionalities are working, my next step
                    will be to develop the command specific functionality such as getting the data/time, weather, opening apps, etc.
